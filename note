Q:
2. validation at commit time
    check if touched set has failed site
++3. Deadlock detection need not happen at every tick. When it does, it should happen at the "beginning of the tick".
4. how to implement multiversion read consistency
    keep multi version in data
5. If no relevant site is available, then T must wait. wait for what?
    recover
++6. when multiple data exists, which one to chose for reading?
    In case the site we read from failed later, we need to abort the transaction
++7. is test as small as sample?
++8. will read only transaction be blocked by write lock?

* If a site in touch set is down, then abort (RO need no do this)

* Available Copies
	--	Read from one copy
	--	Write to all copies

* strict two phase locking
	--	read and write locks
	Get locks as you need them, but donâ€™t release them until the end.

* validation at commit time
	At Commit time: For two phase locked transactions, ensure that all servers that you accessed (read or write) have been up since the first time they were accessed. Otherwise, abort. (Note: Read-only trans-actions need not abort in this case.)

No transaction will have more than one wait.

class:

transaction

transaction manager

lock table

wait table

variable distribution

lock can be promoted, eg:
    R(T1,x1) read lock
    W(T1,x1) promote to write lock
